## Caps the max size of a moai with the size variant. Normal size is 1. 1.5 is slightly taller than the ship. 2 is very large. 3.5+ is giant tier (with 5 being the largest usually)
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 100
Size Variant Cap = 100

## For fine tuning spawn multipliers day to day. Value is a comma separated list. Each value follows the format C%M%, with C being the chance for the spawnrate multiplier to activate on a day (0-100%) and M being the multiplier (0-inf%). If a multiplier isn't activated, the spawnrate will be 0%.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 4%100%, 6%50%, 10%25%
Enemy Spawn Distribution = 4%100%, 6%50%, 10%25%
