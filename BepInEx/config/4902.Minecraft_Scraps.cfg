## [Save/load seeds]
## whether the magnifying glass/minecraft item types should be saved to the save file. this saves the seed that determines the items type, so it will be the same when rejoining.
## loading a save file that has saved seeds without having this enabled or while in lan isn't recommended as the saved seeds can be reset if the number of items is changed.
## saved item types are synced with other players if the synced percentages config is enabled
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
save/load = true

## [Client wait_timer]
## when joining a lobby as non-host magnifying glass items will wait to set their item type until the network message sent by the host has been received or the time spent waiting reached the maximum amount set by this config.
## there will be a log message specifying if the network message was received first or the timer ended first. if the timer is often ending before the message from the host is being received then this should be increased. if the host doesn't have this mod then save/load can be disabled since there won't be a received message from the host so the items would always wait the full timer.
## min is 20, max is 4000. 100 is before the player spawn animation ends, 500 is about 10 seconds, 1000 is about 15 seconds
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 100
timer = 100

## [Synced percentages]
## automatically sync config item percentages/weights with the host. only disable if you're aware that disabling this can cause the item types to not be the same as other players if playing with others that have this mod
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
sync = true

## percentage that a minecraft scrap will replace magnifying glass
## input = percentage, 50 is 50% etc
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 80
base_percent = 80

[Items]

## item types with higher numbers relative to other item types will be more frequent
## (if there are (10 red, 20 green, 30 blue) blocks, and if one block was selected randomly, the color with more blocks would be more likely to be selected, and a color with no blocks couldn't be selected)
## (color is the item type, number of blocks is the config number)
